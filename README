This automated test suite is written in python 2.7, using the following libraries:

 - inittest (used to orchestrate the test suite testcases as well as for the testcases setup
 (create a driver and launch firefox) and tear down (close the browser when the test is complete))
 - selenium webdriver (used to access, fill in forms and click on buttons as a regular user would do to go through
 the workflows)

As per the assignment, the testcases will perform the following tests independently:

 - register for personal account (I'm accessing the wrap authoring page directly bypassing clicking on 'FREE TRIAL')
 - login, create a new wrap from a template and publish it

 I used firefox firebug to pick up all the xpaths I needed for those workflow (I had a hard time finding a box or button ID or Name)

Bugs to fix/Suggested improvements:

 - Adjust the sleeping time in between requests (i.e. the time to complete the template creation can take 1 to 3-4 min depending on the connection) or find a way
 to wait for the task to complete before launching the next one
 - create random dummy accounts for the testing
 - create a .conf file holding all the variables that need to be passed to the test script and parse them in the script
 - create customized Exception log/message for each driver clicks or fill ins errors (right now everything is encapsulated into one try/except method. The
 entire test is failing with a generic/non customized message)
 - log the exception messages into a log file
 - I'm using the same username and password for both test cases so if the registration fails in the first testcase the second testcase will fail automatically.
 - The 2 workflow testcases are a pass or fail positive test cases only. Would need to add negative ones for the same workflow (i.e: inputting an existing email
 address or inputting a wrong password and have the tests fail, ...)
